## About the template files
This download includes templates for each of the four icon sizes. These have been saved as layered Fireworks PNG files, allowing them to be edited with that software. They can also be imported as flat images into other graphic editing packages, and altered using colour overlay layer effects and hue/saturation controls.

## Support and icon suggestions
Please provide any feedback or suggestions in this Get Satisfaction community forum:
